# About NET Flow

NET Flow is a customizable Rainmeter skin that visualizes your system network usage in real time. It displays current and historical network usage using a sleek line graph and includes a current upload and download usage readout. The skin utilizes Rainmeter's native net measures for network usage metrics.

## Customizable Graph Height

The line graph can be customized to fit your maximum download speed (in megabytes).

## Customizable Graph Colors

The line graph can dynamically change colors based on user-defined thresholds, making monitoring performance at a glance easy. These thresholds are fully customizable:

**Cumulative Network Usage**: By default, the line turns red if the total network usage exceeds 50MB/s.
